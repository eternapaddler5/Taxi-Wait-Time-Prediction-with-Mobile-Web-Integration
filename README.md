# Taxi-Wait-Time-Prediction-with-Mobile-Web-Integration

 This assignment is part of the Machine Learning Techniques course. You are 
required to design and implement a predictive system for Taxi Wait Times 
using the dataset provided (taxi_wait_times_50000.csv). The aim is to 
explore, analyze, and model the data to predict the expected wait time for a 
taxi 
under 
different 
conditions.
 In addition to data analysis and modeling, you will also integrate the trained 
model with a simple mobile/web application interface (prototype) that can 
display predictions to users. The assignment will build your skills in data 
cleaning, descriptive analysis, visualization, predictive modeling, and basic 
model 
integration 
with 
mobile/web 
systems.
